Welcome to the official GitHub page for **SupportMail**, a powerful and easy-to-use Discord bot designed to simplify support ticket systems and improve server communication.

## ❗ This Project is Not Open Source (Yet)

Unfortunately, the SupportMail bot is currently **not open source**. I will be making it public some day - but not any time soon.
